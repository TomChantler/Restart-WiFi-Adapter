# Restart-WiFi-Adapter
Restart your WiFi adapter automatically after your Windows 8.1 machine resumes from sleep.

I wrote this because I bought a Surface Pro 3 and my WiFi wouldn't reconnect on resumption from sleep/hibernate, even after trying multiple fixes and updates. If you're having similar issues then maybe it will help you.

Just right-click on `install.bat` and *Run as administrator*. It will be imported as a Windows Scheduled Task and should work on any Windows 8.1 machine.
